Guidelines for LLMs (and Humans) When Contributing
================

Process
-------
When given a task:
1. first, determine if writing or updating code is the most likely solution/answer. If it is not, say so and do not edit any code.
2. If coding is called for, start with tests. You may either modify existing tests to include your new test case, or create new tests.
3. Once the tests are updated and failing (because you haven't written the code yet), then write the code.
4. Once tests are passing, refactor to DRY out, make more legible, and better follow these guidelines.
5. Any time you add or remove any file, make sure to update the tree.txt file.

Refactoring
-----------
When refactoring code:
1. Type hints should be used whenever possible.
2. Don't catch bare exceptions - if you don't know what you are catching, let it rise.
3. Make sure all code has appropriate logging statements.


Module/File Guidelines
------------

Individual modules and files will have guidelines specific to them. Respect these guidelines.
